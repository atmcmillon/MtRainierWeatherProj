Abstract: This is a look at some weather data reports from September 23, 2014 to December 31, 2015
for Mt. Rainier, WA. This dataset is from Kaggle.com, and contains both a weather table, and a
table on climbing statistics. I intend to use this data project as practice, as well as experiments
on modeling, and predicting. Some questions I wanted to find specifically about the weather reports
are:

1. Temperature, Humidity, and Wind vector(speed and direction) statistics, since topics like
solar radiation are not important to most people. These entries are also listed as averages,
which I interpret as daily averages and/or area averages.
a. Means, modes, minimums, and maximums for each of the four above topics.

2. Can we use previous data and perhaps better prediction libraries/software to predict outcomes
for the weather in 2016-onward?
a. Can we find a dataset that actually has this information for 2016 besides online weather
reports?
b. Can we approach a best fitting polynomial or other function that approximates the weather
patterns?

3. Are there any correlations between weahter phenomena?
a. Temperature vs. Relative Humidity
b. Temperature vs. Wind Direction and Wind Speed
c. Wind vs. Relative Humidity

Methodology: Python is a widely used and understood language by programmers and lay people alike,
so this will be my main file for writing queries, searching data, and cleaning data. Modules such
as Pandas, SweetViz, and NumPy are excellent libraries for data structuring and arranging.
Datetime is a good library for cleaning up columns with time-sensitive data. I used it to even
establish the timelines for my graphs with Matplotlib. Matplotlib is excellent for also creating
visuals such as temperature data against each day in 2015.

Research:

1. In the Python script for this project, I have comments marking the statistics about each
subject:

    Temperature:
    Average temperature, 28.02 deg F
    Median temperature, 27.36 deg F
    Highest temperature, 56.15 deg F
    Lowest temperature, -0.17 deg F
    The most common temp, 25.92 deg F

    Wind Direction:
    Average wind direction, 199.44 deg(or SSE)
    Median wind direction, 227.47 deg(or ESE)
    Mode wind direction, 224.60 deg(or SE)
    Note: This is a data column that cannot use minimums and maximums as a part of its stats.
    This is due to the nature of measuring angles on a 2D plane, and that there is no min/max,
    only reference and matching angles.

    Wind Speed:
    AVG: 13.02 mph
    MED: 8.71 mph
    HI: 65.85 mph
    LO: 0.0 mph
    MODE: 0.0mph

    Relative Humidity:
    AVG: 62.5%
    MED: 64.1%
    HI: 100.0%
    LO: 9.7%
    MODE: 100%
